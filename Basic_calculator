	// Create var (w/o values), prompt for input with printf, value the var with scanf_s and DONT FORGET the "&" before the var_name!
	// Also, if I'm accepting DOUBLE I need to scanf_s for "%lf" rather than "%d" or "%f". Then I need to printf "%f" as well.
	// NOTE FROM WIKI: %lf : Scan as a double floating-point number. "Float" format with the "long" specifier.
