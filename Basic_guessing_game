// BASIC GUESSING GAME (IF statement & WHILE loop)
// ================================

// This game will ask the user to guess a secret number.
// If the GUESS is wrong it will prompt to "TRY AGAIN" from then on.


int main() {

	int secretNumber = 5;
	int guess = 0;

	printf("Enter a number: ");
	scanf_s("%d", &guess);

	if (guess == secretNumber) {
		printf("You WIN!");		// This only (!) prints if the guess is right at the first try.
	} else;
			while (guess != secretNumber) {
				printf("Try again...: ");
				scanf_s("%d", &guess);
			}

	printf("You WIN!");

	return 0;
