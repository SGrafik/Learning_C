// ADVANCED GUESSING GAME (NESTED IF statement & WHILE loop & EXIT)
// ========================================

// This game will ask the user to guess a secret number.
// If the guess is correct the game will print "You WIN!".
// The user has 3 tries only. I'm using "counter++" to increment the VAR. 
// If the GUESS is wrong it will prompt to "Try again..." twice after the first try.
// If the user is out of tries the game will print "You LOOSE..."
